### DATA ANALYSIS section contains the following questions: 

### 1. How many total trips were made by members and casuals what is %membership?

SELECT DISTINCT
(SELECT count(is_member) FROM trips WHERE is_member=0) as casual_users,
(SELECT count(is_member) FROM trips WHERE is_member=1) as Members,
(SELECT count(is_member) FROM trips WHERE is_member=1)/count(is_member) as Percent_membership
FROM trips;

#Casual users: 124538, Members: 856586	
# 87% of the users are members

### 2. What is the average trip duration for members and casual users? What is the max trip duration for casual and member?

SELECT IF(is_member=0, 'Casual users', 'Members') as User_type, count(is_member) as Trips, 
round(avg(duration_sec)/60,1) as Avg_duration_minutes
FROM trips
GROUP BY is_member;

/* From the summary table, we find even though 87% of the trips are made by members, average trip duration of members is almost
 12 minutes and 30 seconds whereas casual members have trips of average 21 minutes.
 */
 

### 3. What is the total number of trips each month?

WITH month_table as (
SELECT month(str_to_date(start_date, "%m/%d/%Y")) as trip_month
FROM trips)

SELECT (CASE WHEN trip_month=5 THEN 'May' ELSE 'June' END) as trip_month, 
count(trip_month) as trip_count
FROM month_table
GROUP BY trip_month;

# May- 455,261 trips; June- 525,863 trips

### 4. What is the % increase of trips from May to June?

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE trip_increase (
may_trips INT NULL,
june_trips INT NULL);

insert into trip_increase values(
455261, 525863);

SELECT *, round((june_trips-may_trips)/may_trips,3) as percent_increase_in_trips FROM trip_increase;

# There is 15.5% increase in trips from May to June month

-- drop temporary table user_increase;

### 5. Give the top 5 station names where trips are starting

SELECT t.start_station_code as Station_code, s.station_name, count(start_station_code) as num_trips,
 round((count(start_station_code)/981124)*100,2) as percent_of_total
FROM trips t
JOIN stations s
ON t.start_station_code= s.code
GROUp BY start_station_code
ORDER BY num_trips DESC
LIMIT 5;


###6. What is the usage ratio of members and casual users in weekdays and weekends?
# We use WEEKDAY(date) to get weekday. Here 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday
# 0-4 are weekdays, 5 and 6 are weekends. 

WITH weekday_table AS (
	SELECT str_to_date(start_date,'%m/%d/%Y') AS start_date, 
		is_member, duration_sec 
	FROM trips)
SELECT IF(weekday(start_date)>4, "Weekend", "Weekdays") as week_day, 
IF(is_member=0, 'Casual users', 'Members') as User_type, 
count(is_member) as num_trips, 
IF(is_member=1, concat(round((count(is_member)/856586)*100),'%'), 
	concat(round((count(is_member)/124538)*100),'%')) as percent_usage
FROM weekday_table
GROUP BY User_type, week_day
ORDER BY User_type;

# Thus, from this we see that casual users use almost equally on weekdays and weekends whereas members use 75% of their trips on work days.

###7. What is the time where most number of trips are made?

WITH demo as (
SELECT  left(right(start_date, 5),2) as time_in_hours, right(right(start_date, 5),2) as time_in_min,
round((left(right(start_date, 5),2) + (right(right(start_date, 5),2)/60)),2) as hour_min,
count(is_member) as num_trips
FROM TRIPS
GROUP BY time_in_hours, time_in_min)
SELECT
(CASE WHEN hour_min between 0 and 6 THEN "12:00AM to 06:00AM" WHEN hour_min between 6 and 9 THEN "06:00AM to 09:00AM" 
	WHEN hour_min between 9 and 12 THEN "09:00AM to 12:00PM" WHEN hour_min between 12 and 16 THEN "12:00PM to 04:00PM"
    WHEN hour_min between 16 and 20 THEN "04:00PM to 08:00PM" ELSE "08:00PM to 12:00AM" END) as time_line,
sum(num_trips) as num_trips, round(sum(num_trips)/981124,2) as percent_trips
FROM demo
GROUP BY time_line;

# From this table, we understand that almost 55% of the trips take place between 12:00PM and 08:00PM due to lunch time travels and errands while 
#returning home
